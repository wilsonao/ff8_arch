# Final Fantasy VIII Setup Guide

This is the short version. The complete player guide — every option, how checks
and items behave in-game, saves and reloading, trackers, client commands,
troubleshooting — lives on GitHub:
https://github.com/wilsonao/ff8_arch/blob/main/docs/player-guide.md

## Requirements

- **Final Fantasy VIII** — the Steam **2013 release**, English (`FF8_EN.exe`).
  Remastered, the PSX version, and the non-English executables are not supported.
- **Windows** (the client attaches to the running game process).
- **Archipelago 0.6.7 or newer**: https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases
- **`ff8.apworld`** from this world's Releases page:
  https://github.com/wilsonao/ff8_arch/releases

No game files are modified. Graphics, music, and texture mods (FFNx, Junction VIII
asset mods) are fine; avoid gameplay mods that change encounters, drops, draw
points, or the save layout.

## Installation

1. Open the Archipelago **Launcher** → **Install APWorld** → select `ff8.apworld`
   (or copy the file into your Archipelago `custom_worlds/` folder).
2. Restart the Launcher. **FF8 Client** now appears in its list.

That is the whole install — nothing else to download, install, or configure.

## Your options file

Launcher → **Generate Template Options** → edit `Final Fantasy VIII.yaml` (or use
this game's options page on the WebHost) and give it to whoever is generating.
Presets: *All Checks*, *Core Only*, *Junction Master*.

## Connecting

1. Start Final Fantasy VIII and begin a **New Game** (a fresh game is strongly
   recommended — see the player guide's *Saves* section for what happens with an
   existing save).
2. Open the client, pre-connected if you can:
   - **From a WebHost room page** (archipelago.gg or a self-hosted WebHost): click
     **your slot name** in the room's player list. The Launcher opens and asks which
     client to use — choose **FF8 Client**. It starts already pointed at the right
     server, port, and slot.
   - **Otherwise**: Launcher → **FF8 Client**, enter `host:port` in the address bar
     (or `/connect host:port`), then your slot name.
3. The client finds `FF8_EN.exe` on its own and attaches; it keeps retrying until the
   game is running. `/ff8` shows the connection status.
4. Play. Items arrive while you are on a field screen (never in menus or battles), and
   reloading an older save re-delivers whatever that save is missing.

Keep the client running while you play.

## Trackers (optional)

- **PopTracker**: download `ff8_ap_tracker.zip` from the same Releases page, drop it
  into PopTracker's `packs/` folder, pick **Final Fantasy VIII (Archipelago)**, and
  connect the built-in **AP** autotracker with your server and slot. It follows your
  checks, received items, story progress, and your slot's options automatically.
- **Universal Tracker**: needs no extra files — the maps ship inside `ff8.apworld`.

## If something goes wrong

- **"Not attached to FF8_EN.exe"** — the game isn't running, or it isn't the Steam
  2013 English version. The client says what it actually found (Remastered, a
  non-English executable, only the launcher open, or blocked memory access) —
  follow that message.
- **A check didn't send** — `/ff8missed` lists any location that reads as satisfied
  but unsent; `/ff8check <name>` sends one the client provably missed (for example a
  boss killed while the client was closed).
- **Logs** are in `logs/FF8Client_*.txt` inside your Archipelago folder — attach the
  current one to any bug report: https://github.com/wilsonao/ff8_arch/issues
